# StringLibrary
A library to make string functions, such as trimming and much more, easier.

## Why you should use this library
It will save you time. Yes, you can write your own string extension methods, but you also have to write unit tests for them. This library is fully unit tested so you can include it and move on.

You get:
1. Consistent string extension methods between projects
2. Faster time to code, as you don't have to roll your own extension methods and then either lack code coverage or have to unit test them.
